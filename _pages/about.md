I am a research scientist at NTT Research, and a visiting scientist at Cornell, working in the lab of Peter McMahon. My research interest falls broadly within the intersection of optics and machine learning, on how we can use optics for accelerating machine learning computations, as well as employing machine learning techniques towards novel photonics devices for quantum and nonlinear optics. I received my B.A. in engineering physics from University of Toronto in 2014, and my Ph.D. in applied physics from Stanford University in 2019.

# Research Interest

My research interests stem from viewing physical systems as complex, controllable nonlinear functions that act on physical inputs and parameters, to produce a physical output. This is analogous to neural networks, which can also be broadly interpreted as complex nonlinear functions, with parameters that are trained to perform some desired task. Thus, my research interests revolves around studying the exchange of ideas between the fields of programmable photonics and artificial intelligence, and can be characterized by three main thrusts:


- Performing machine learning computations with photonics
- Building complex, high-dimensional programmable photonic hardware
- Programmable quantum and nonlinear optics
